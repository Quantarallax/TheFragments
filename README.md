# The Fragments
A text adventure written in an earlier version of Adventuron.

## Play Online
Playable at https://xyzzy.app

## Adventuron Editor
Load the code into the adventuron editor here: https://adventuron.io/classroom/ (includes full training, which won't take you long)
You will need to modify it to get it in-line with the newest and best version of Adventuron to compile.

## In Three Parts with pseudo-pixel graphics

* Part one is fully playable.
* Part two is a bit convoluted, though fully playable.
* Part three is unfinished, and was where I realised bigger doesn't necessarily mean better. It ran away from me.

Have fun!
